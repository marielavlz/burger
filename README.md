# Eat-da-Burger!

_Eat-da-Burger_ is a burger logger application built with MySQL, Handlebars, and a custom made ORM. 

#### How it Works

Simply put, a user will enter the name of a burger they wish to consume. The name will appear on the left side of the screen with an __EAT THIS__ option. Once the user clicks on __EAT THIS__, the burger will be moved onto the Eaten column. The created burger is stored in a MySQL database and utilizes Express routes as well as an ORM to connect the database to the Node environment.

#### NPM Packages Required
* express
* body-parser
* method-override
